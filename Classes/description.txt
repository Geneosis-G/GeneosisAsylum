[quote=About this mod]I can hardly stop laughing after testing this mod XD This is probably the most hilarious mod I have ever made, the random actions of humans are just so dumb that they make me laugh every time X)
Anyway, that mod was a suggestion posted on my request thread and was originally called Rioter Goat or Anarchist Goat, anyway I didn't like those name because I think they sound a bit too "serious" in this funny game ^^ Also by assimilating the new AI I made for NPCs as "madness" I could add various other fun actions that actually make some sense for a mad person :p
So that's it this mod is basically just a new AI for NPCs, I started with my own Zombie AI and improved it to give to the NPCs the ability to attack any item. I also fixed some bugs and glitghy behaviour of the Zombie AI that I didn't understand before :)
When that part was complete, the mod felt a bit easter-egg-less, so I thought about something that could go well with the context of insanity... The answer came easily as I had this stupid meme song playing in loop in my mind all the time I was working on the mod X)
